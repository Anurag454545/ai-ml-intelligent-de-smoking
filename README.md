# AI/ML-Based Intelligent De-Smoking Algorithm

Welcome to the **AI/ML-Based Intelligent De-Smoking Algorithm** repository. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to remove smoke or haze from images and videos, enhancing visibility and clarity.

## Overview

Environmental factors like smoke, fog, and haze can significantly degrade image quality, affecting various computer vision applications. This project aims to restore clear images by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Techniques to prepare data for model training.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) tailored for de-smoking tasks.
- **Training Pipeline:** Scripts and configurations for model training.
- **Inference:** Tools to apply the trained model to new images or videos.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and methods to assess model performance.
